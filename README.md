##  Overview of the Analysis:
### For this assignment the goal was to be able to take data from the web and upload it not onto the computer but to examine it online using tools like google colab and spark. With this data we we able to filter and create data frames to examine date. In this case of this challenge the goal was to look at data and manipulate to only show certain aspects such as five star reviews that are paid and unpaid.
## Results:
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there? There were 17,481 vine reviews and 8,984,400 non-vine reviews.
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? There were a total of 4,818,203 five star reviews that were non-vine (unpaid). There were a total of 6,522 five starts review that were vine (paid).
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? 0.001352 is the percent of vine reviews that were five stars. 0.998648 is the percent of non-vine reviews that were five stars.
## Summary:
### I don't believe there is any positive bias because there are more unpaid reviews that are five star than there are paid reviews that are five star. If there was positivity bias then you would think there would be more paid five star views because the reviewers would be more inlcined to rate the product higher. Another analysis that could be helpful is to find out the the percentage of paid reviews for each star rating and do the same for the unpaid reviews. This would best be displayed as a table for comparison purposes and would better show if there is any bias present.
